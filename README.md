_Version 0_

_Created in January 2021._

2SR, The Super Simple Role Playing 
Game System, uses FUDGE dice (dF) 
rolled via the FATE Tarot Dice method.
And is similar in intent to 
SHERPA: an RPG simple enough that the
character sheet can fit on the back
of a business card or a paper napkin,
yet rich enough that it can support 
complex game play mechanics.
