2SR, The Super Simple Role Playing 
Game System, uses [FUDGE](https://amzn.to/3qnG23h) 
dice (dF) 
rolled via the 
[FATE Tarot Dice](https://web.archive.org/web/20110612000733/http://www.hill-kleerup.org/pmwiki/FATE/D14TarotCardSystem)
method. It is similar in intent to 
[SHERPA:](http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/s4.html) an RPG simple enough that the
character sheet can fit on the back
of a business card or a paper napkin,
yet rich enough that it can support 
complex game play mechanics.
