2SR, The Super Simple Role Playing 
Game System, uses [FUDGE](https://amzn.to/3qnG23h) 
dice (dF) 
rolled via the 
[FATE Tarot Dice](https://web.archive.org/web/20110612000733/http://www.hill-kleerup.org/pmwiki/FATE/D14TarotCardSystem)
method. It is similar in intent to 
[SHERPA:](http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/s4.html) an RPG simple enough that the
character sheet can fit on the back
of a business card or a paper napkin,
yet rich enough that it can support 
complex game play mechanics. It is 
also similar in intent to [GURPS](https://amzn.to/3u4j5En)
in that it is a universal RPG system 
that can be adapted to any sort of 
milieu. 

However where GURPS achieves 
universality through describing 
numerous special cases, 2SR takes
the opposite approach and defines
almost nothing, leaving the specifics 
of world mechanics up to the 
Game Master (GM) and
the players.
